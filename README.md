# Ali_S_Integrated App

# Setting up

1. Create a new db called ```auth_ex```
2. From inside the file directory, run ```npm install``` to install the node modules
3. Migrate the db with ```php artisan migrate```
4. Seed the db with ```php artisan db:seed```
5. Run ```php artisan serve```
6. Sorry For not seeding all the databases, time was a factor. You can login with the email ```admin@email.com``` and the password ```password```
